### How to Use

1. Run the script `video.py`.
2. Choose your video source.
3. Choose an output folder to save the video.
4. You can check the **"Use scene detection"** option if you want the video to be automatically split by scene.
5. If the scene detection option is **not checked**, you can manually cut the video by specifying:
   - **Video start second** (start time)
   - **Video end second** (end time)

Feel free to set the start and end times as needed.
